# Capstone Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This repository contains a final project that I did as part of a data analytics course. It takes a look at UFO sighting locations, descriptions, and characteristics. It also looks at some of the top Science Fiction movies and their potential impact on UFO sightings. Did they cause an increase/descrease in sightings?
