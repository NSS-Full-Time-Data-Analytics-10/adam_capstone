# Executive Summary

I will analyze UFO reporting data for the U.S. from 1970 to the present, looking for patterns in sightings based on time of day/month/year/location and attempt to use these conclusions along with movie release data for 10 of the most popular/highest grossing films, to determine whether certain Sci-Fi movie releases have an effect on UFO reports. I will also be mapping the locations of some of the largest U.S. Air Force bases to see whether these also have an effect on the number of UFO sightings.

## Motivation

"The truth is out there."

## Data Question

Do popular Sci-Fi movies that feature aliens/UFOs, have any relation to the number of UFOs reported? More specifically, do UFO reports increase in the 30 day period following one of these movie releases?
Does the presence of nearby Air Force bases have any effect on the number of reported sightings?

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Will utilize either Tableau or PowerBI for data visualization. Decision will be made once I see which one handles a large amount of plot points on a map better.


## Schedule

- **8/4**   : Complete web scraping, data cleaning, and import into Tableau/PowerBI.
- **8/7**   : Make a final decision on the dashboarding software to use.
-             Have at least a basic map with all of the 120,000 points mapped in some form, including Air Force base locations
- **8/8**   : Get started on creating relevant charts
- **8/9**   : Continue working on charts and making comparisons
- **8/10**  : Create heatmap showing sighting location changes through the years
- **8/12**  : Work on creating the actual presentation, including making it visually appealing
- **8/13**  : Eat pizza
- **8/14**  : Week of: Continue working on presentation to create a cohesive story using an interactive dashboard
                       Rehearse presentation
                       

## Data Sources 

- UFO reporting data: https://nuforc.org/databank/
- Lat/lng data: https://developers.google.com/maps
- Movie data: https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/worldwide/all-movies/creative-types/science-fiction
              

## Challenges

- Scraping data from the source website.
- Getting image links based on reportlinks scraped from the source website.
- Getting lat/lng coordinates for approximately 120,000 locations
- Mapping that much data to a map in PowerBI/Tableau in a way so that it doesn't look extremely cluttered
- Creating a visually appealing and interactive dashboard that tells a story in a way that doesn't make me look crazy
