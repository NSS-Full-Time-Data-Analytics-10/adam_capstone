# Executive Summary

I will analyze UFO reporting data for the U.S. from 1970 to July 2023, looking for patterns in sightings based on time of day/month/year/location and attempt to use these conclusions along with movie release data for 10 of the most popular/highest grossing films, to determine whether certain Sci-Fi movie releases have an effect on UFO reports. 

## Motivation

"The truth is out there."

## Data Question

Do popular Sci-Fi movies that feature aliens/UFOs, have any relation to the number of UFOs reported? 
More specifically, do UFO reports increase in the 30 day period following one of these movie releases?


## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Will use PowerBI
- HeatMap
- Time lapse map


## Schedule

- **8/4**   : Complete web scraping, data cleaning, and import into Tableau/PowerBI.
- **8/7**   : Make a final decision on the dashboarding software to use.
-             Have at least a basic map with all of the 120,000 points mapped in some form, including Air Force base locations
- **8/8**   : Get started on creating relevant charts
- **8/9**   : Continue working on charts and making comparisons
- **8/10**  : Create heatmap showing sighting location changes through the years
- **8/12**  : Work on creating the actual presentation, including making it visually appealing
- **8/13**  : Eat pizza
- **8/14**  : Week of: Continue working on presentation to create a cohesive story using an interactive dashboard
                       Rehearse presentation
                       

## Data Sources 

- UFO reporting data: https://nuforc.org/databank/
- Lat/lng data: https://developers.google.com/maps
- Movie data: https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/worldwide/all-movies/creative-types/science-fiction
- Air Force base location data: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Air_Force_installations



## Challenges

- Scraping data from the source website.
- Getting image links based on reportlinks scraped from the source website.
- Getting lat/lng coordinates for approximately 120,000 locations
- Mapping that much data to a map in PowerBI/Tableau in a way so that it doesn't look extremely cluttered
- Creating a visually appealing and interactive dashboard that tells a story in a way that doesn't make me look crazy
